# DESCRIPTION: This script identifies Objective-C symbols within the
# `FirebaseFirestoreInternal.xcframework` that are not automatically linked
# when used in a client target. Because the
# `FirebaseFirestoreInternal.xcframework` should function without clients
# needing to pass the `-ObjC` flag, this script catches potential regressions
# that break that requirement.
#
# DEPENDENCIES: This script depends on the given Firebase repo's `Package.swift`
# using the `FIREBASECI_USE_LOCAL_FIRESTORE_ZIP` env var to swap the Firestore
# target definition out to instead reference a *local* binary using the
# `.binaryTarget(path:)` API.
#
# DESIGN: This script creates an executable package that depends on Firestore
# via a local binary SPM target. The package is built twice, once with the
# -ObjC flag and once without. The linked Objective-C symbols are then
# stripped from each build's resulting executable. The symbols are then diffed
# to determine if there exists symbols that were only linked due to the -ObjC
# flag.
#
# USAGE: ./check_firestore_symbols.sh <PATH_TO_FIREBASE_REPO> <PATH_TO_FIRESTORE_XCFRAMEWORK>
