# SDK Health Metrics Report Generation
This directory includes code coverage report generation and binary size report generation.

## Code Coverage Report Generation

This tool is to help generate coverage reports for pull requests. It's defined by the [test_coverage  workflow](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/main/scripts/health_metrics/file_patterns.json).

Coverage reports of SDK frameworks will be displayed in a pull request if the change is under corresponding SDK file patterns.

[UpdatedFilesCollector](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/tree/main/scripts/health_metrics/generate_code_coverage_report/Sources/UpdatedFilesCollector) will detect file changes and compare file paths to file patterns in [file_patterns.json](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/main/scripts/health_metrics/file_patterns.json). If updated file paths fit any patterns, corresponding SDK coverage job will be triggered.

### Add a new coverage workflow

To create a code coverage workflow for a new SDK,
1. Add `newsdk` and its patterns in [file_patterns.json](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/main/scripts/health_metrics/file_patterns.json).
2. Add a new output flag, e.g. `newsdk_run_job`, in the [coverage workflow](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/64d50a7f7b3af104a88f9c9203285ae20ea309d4/.github/workflows/test_coverage.yml#L17). `newsdk_run_job` should be aligned with the name of SDK `newsdk` in file_patterns.json.
3. Add a newsdk coverage job in the [workflow](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/test_coverage.yml):
```
pod-lib-lint-newsdk:
    needs: check
    # Don't run on private repo unless it is a PR.
    if: always() && github.repository == 'Firebase/firebase-ios-sdk' && (needs.check.outputs.newsdk_run_job == 'true'|| github.event.pull_request.merged)
    runs-on: macOS-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [iOS]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@359bebbc29cbe6c87da6bc9ea3bc930432750108
      with:
        ruby-version: '2.7'
    - name: Setup Bundler
      run: scripts/setup_bundler.sh
    - name: Build and test
      run: ./scripts/health_metrics/pod_test_code_coverage_report.sh FirebaseNewSDK "${{ matrix.target }}"
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: codecoverage
        path: /Users/runner/*.xcresult
```
Add the job name to the [`needs` of `create_report` job](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/64d50a7f7b3af104a88f9c9203285ae20ea309d4/.github/workflows/test_coverage.yml#L277).

4. If this newsdk podspec has unit test setup, e.g. [database](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/64d50a7f7b3af104a88f9c9203285ae20ea309d4/FirebaseDatabase.podspec#L44-L57), with `unit_tests.scheme = { :code_coverage => true }`, the code coverage workflow should run unit tests through podspecs and utilize those coverage data and nothing is needed to update here. Otherwise, add [another way of running tests](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/64d50a7f7b3af104a88f9c9203285ae20ea309d4/scripts/health_metrics/pod_test_code_coverage_report.sh#L26) and generating xcresult bundles with code coverage data in pod_test_code_coverage_report.sh.

## Binary Size Report Generation

This tool is to generate a report for SDK binary sizes.
[create_binary_size_report.sh](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/main/scripts/health_metrics/create_binary_size_report.sh)
will trigger [BinarySizeReportGenerator](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/main/scripts/health_metrics/generate_code_coverage_report/Sources/BinarySizeReportGenerator/BinarySizeReportGeneration.swift)
which will run [cocoapods-size](https://github.com/google/cocoapods-size)
to create a binary size report and either post it in PRs in presubmits or
upload it to the Metrics Service.

The cocoapods-size tool measures an iOS SDK size by comparing the [64 bit ARM](https://github.com/google/cocoapods-size/blob/master/size_build_configuration.json#L5) slice
before and after installing the pod to an [iOS skeleton app](https://github.com/google/cocoapods-size/tree/master/sizetestproject).
More about CocoaPods Size measurement could be found [here](https://github.com/google/cocoapods-size#cocoapods-size-measurement).

### Replicate a binary size measurement for a released SDK

To replicate an SDK binary size measurement locally, we can run the following
script to get the binary size of the latest released FirebaseABTesting SDK.
```
git clone https://github.com/google/cocoapods-size
cd cocoapods-size
python3 measure_cocoapod_size.py --cocoapods FirebaseABTesting
```

### Environment Setup

The `binary_size_metrics` on GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/health-metrics-presubmit.yml)
is running binary size measurement presubmits and postsubmits. The environment for this job
could be found in `runs-on`. More details about the envionment could be found [here](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments#available-environments).

Factors below might also affect the binary size:
- Each testapp is measured by a default version Xcode from the GitHub Actions environment above.
- Architecture is set to `arm64` and the destination is `generic/platform=iOS Simulator` when a testapp is built.
- The source of dependencies is the [SpecStaging repo](https://github.com/firebase/SpecsStaging), which is for prerelease, and [CocoaPods CDN](https://cdn.cocoapods.org).
